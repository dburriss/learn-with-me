# Using VIM

This is a journey to learn Vim. Not THE journey but a journey. There are many ways you could learn ViM. It consists of katas you can do to learn and practice using Vim.

## Ways to use

There are multiple ways you can use these katas to learn Vim.

You could use them as a light introduction to the most important things to know in Vim by going through the katas once like a tutorial.

Another way is to use them as a tool to memorize the most important parts of Vim by going through the kata a few times. For this I suggest the following schedule:

```
Day 1: Complete kata twice in the morning and once in the evening.  
Days 2: Complete kata once.
Day 5: Complete kata once.
Day 25: Complete kata once.
```

If after this long you are not using it regularly... why did you learn it? :)

The final way to use this is the way it is intended. As a kata. Repeat it multiple times a day. First practice slowly but each time try do it faster until the movements are automatic.
