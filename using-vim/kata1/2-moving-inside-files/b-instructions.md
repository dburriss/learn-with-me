# Moving inside of files (2/3)

We practiced some basic moving around using single cursor jumps and going to a specific line.

> Remember we move around in NORMAL mode, so hit ESC if you are in another mode.

## Instructions

2. Move down to the bottom of the page using `G` (`Shift-g`).
4. You can also page forward to the end of the document using `Ctrl-f`.
6. You can scroll down by half pages using `Ctrl-d`.
