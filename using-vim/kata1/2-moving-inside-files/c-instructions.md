# Moving inside of files (3/3)

We have small jumps and massive jumps down. What about getting around in a specific paragraph or piece of code?
We will go over a few of the many motions available for navigating around text.

## Instructions

1. Type: `9gg` to get onto the next line.
2. Press `w` to move over each word in this line until you reach HERE. Press `j` to move down.
3. Press `b` to move to the start of point 3 (line 10). Now press `e` to skip words but going to the end of the word instead of the beginning. Continue till you get HERE. Press `j` to drop to the next line.
4. Use `(` to jump back sentences until you are the start of this one. Use `)` to move to the end of this sentence.
5. Now press `{` to jump to the start of this paragraph. Press `}` to jump to the end.
6. Press `|` to move the cursor to the start of the current line. You may need to move around a bit to test it out.

> Tip: you can append a number to `w` and `b` to jump multiple words eg. `3w` to jump 3 words. This can be applied to other movements like `j` and `k`.

7. Continue on to *3-buffers/a-instructions.md*.
