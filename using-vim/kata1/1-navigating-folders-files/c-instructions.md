# Navigating folders and files (3/3)

By default VIM uses a single window. So far we have been loading files into the same window. Later we will go into details about working with windows but before moving on let's take a look at the basics.

## Instructions

First, let's see VIM's help section in action. This loads into a new window, so is an easy example.

Type: `:help jumplist`  
You should see 2 windows. The newly created help window at the top, and your existing window underneath that.
You can use the arrow keys (or `j` and `k`) to scroll though the documentation.  

Now run the quit command by typing: `:q`

Use `:Ex` or `:edit` (you can use `:e` instead of `:edit`) to navigate to `2-moving-inside-files/a-instructions.md` to move onto the next part of the kata.
